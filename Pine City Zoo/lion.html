                        <h3>LION</h3>
<p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals belonging to the family Felidae and the species Panthera leo. 
    They are often referred to as the "king of the jungle" and are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa. 
    Lions are known for their social behavior, living in groups called prides.</p>
<p>Lions are apex predators, primarily hunting large ungulates such as zebras and wildebeests. 
    They are known for their powerful build and distinctive manes in males. Lions are also known for their roar, which can be heard from miles away.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
