                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>Gemsboks are large antelopes native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. 
    They belong to the family Bovidae and are known for their striking appearance, featuring long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. 
    Gemsboks are well adapted to survive in harsh desert environments, primarily found in the Kalahari Desert and other dry savannahs. 
    Their scientific name is Oryx gazella.</p>
<p>Gemsboks are herbivorous, primarily grazing on grasses and browsing on shrubs. 
    They can go for long periods without water, obtaining moisture from the vegetation they consume.
    Their strong legs and hooves allow them to travel great distances in search of food and water.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
<p>You will find the gemsboks at pen A12, near the desert exhibit.</p>
