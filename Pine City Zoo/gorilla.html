                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are the largest primates and belong to the family Hominidae.
    There are two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). 
    They are primarily found in the forests of central Africa, including countries like Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Gorillas are herbivorous, mainly consuming leaves, stems, and fruits. 
    They are social animals, living in groups called troops led by a dominant male known as a silverback. 
    Gorillas are known for their intelligence and strong familial bonds.</p>
