                        <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, belonging to the family Giraffidae and the species Giraffa camelopardalis. 
    They are easily recognizable by their long necks and legs, as well as their unique coat patterns made up of irregular brown patches.
    Giraffes inhabit savannahs and open woodlands across Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Giraffes are herbivorous and primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees, particularly acacias. 
    Their long necks allow them to reach high branches that other herbivores cannot access. 
    Giraffes have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen B5, next to the savannah area.</p>
